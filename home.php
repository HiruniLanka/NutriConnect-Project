    <h1>What is Malnutrition?</h1>
    <div class="mal-box">
      <p>"Malnutrition refers to deficiencies or excesses in nutrient intake,
        imbalance of essential nutrients or impaired nutrient utilization.
        The double burden of malnutrition consists of both undernutrition and overweight and obesity,
        as well as diet-related noncommunicable diseases. Undernutrition manifests in four broad forms:
        wasting, stunting, underweight, and micronutrient deficiencies.</p>
      <p>
        Wasting is defined as low weight-for-height. It often indicates recent and severe weight loss,
        although it can also persist for a long time. It usually occurs when a person has not had food of
        adequate quality and quantity and/or they have had frequent or prolonged illnesses. Wasting in
        children is associated with a higher risk of death if not treated properly. Stunting is defined as
        low height-for-age. It is the result of chronic or recurrent undernutrition, usually associated with
        poverty, poor maternal health and nutrition, frequent illness and/or inappropriate feeding and care
        in early life. Stunting prevents children from reaching their physical and cognitive potential.
        Underweight is defined as low weight-for-age. A child who is underweight may be stunted, wasted or
        both.
      </p>
      <p>Micronutrient deficiencies are a lack of vitamins and minerals that are essential
        for body functions such as producing enzymes, hormones and other substances needed for growth and
        development."</p>

              <h3>Wasting</h3>
              <p>
                Wasting, or acute malnutrition, is when one is too thin for
                their height.
                It can be a sudden change or one that occurs gradually but
                persistently.
                It can be treated, but moderate and severe cases carry an
                increased risk of death.

              <h3>Stunting</h3>
              <p class>
                Stunting, or chronic malnutrition, refers to children who are
                too short for their age.
                It can occur when children do not have access to diverse
                nutrients, drink dirty or contaminated water, or lack proper
                healthcare.
                Stunted growth in children can cause life-long physical and
                cognitive damage.

                Overweight means being too heavy for one’s height. If one is
                overweight,
                they are at greater risk of diet-related, non-communicable
                diseases later in life.

          <p>Without the proper means to afford food rich in nutrients or any food at all, people often suffer.
            According to the World Data Lab, 35% of Africans live in extreme poverty, while the World Bank estimates
            that more than 48 to 59 million people in South Asia became or remained poor because of the COVID-19

          <p>In any location, poverty and an unequal distribution of resources can seriously undermine one’s ability to
            consume a well-balanced diet. Women are disproportionately affected by hunger; in nearly two-thirds of the
            world’s countries, women are more likely than men to suffer from hunger and food insecurity.</p>

            more than 22 million people from 2019.</p>
